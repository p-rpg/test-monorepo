- Keep Rust crates inside a `rust/` directory if they are added in the future.
- Keep Zig packages inside a `zig/` directory if they are added in the future.
- Crate/package identifier must be start with `p-` or `p_` while directory name does not.
- Document new features in `README.md` files within the relevant directories.
